# Decorator Pattern

* A Decorator pattern can be used to attach additional responsibilities to an object either statically or dynamically.

* Suppose we have a Christmas tree object and we want to decorate it. The decoration does not change the object itself; it’s just that in addition to the Christmas tree, we’re adding some decoration items like garland, tinsel, tree-topper, bubble lights, etc.
